# Pong_Atari_Reinforcement_Learning

Trained a Deep Reinforcement Learning model (DQN) to win 21-0 on Atari's Pong game. Improved convergence by implementing Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning, changing the exploration and exploitation strategy and seeding the Q Learner differently.
